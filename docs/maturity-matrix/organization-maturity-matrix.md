# Organization Maturity Matrix

## Transparency

### Plans & Products - Level 0

- Individuals and teams do not regularly disclose their plans or products to
  multiple stakeholders.
- No formal actions exists at the organization.

### Plans & Products - Level 1

- Individuals and teams give visibility to their plans or products to multiple
  stakeholders, before they are started.
- Shared roadmap.

### Plans & Products - Level 2

- There are already shared roadmaps with clear guidelines and contribution rules
  where stakeholders can provide feedback.
- However this is not standardized across the organization and not all of the
  projects provide this info.

### Plans & Products - Level 3

- Roadmaps are shared by default and there is a standard process and homogeneous
  way to do this across the organization at the level of each InnerSource
  project.
- This contains clear rules to contribute and influence in the roadmap.
