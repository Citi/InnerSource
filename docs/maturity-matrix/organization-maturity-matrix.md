This document also contains input from the
[FINOS InnerSource SIG meeting held in April 2021](finos/InnerSource#10). This
is intended as a working document for the FINOS InnerSource SIG to build upon as
they work towards producing an InnerSource maturity matrix for the Financial
Services sector.

## Purpose

The purpose of the InnerSource Maturity Matrix Tool is to assess the InnerSource
health for an organization.

### Definitions

- **Level 0**: Accidental - individual initiatives
- **Level 1**: Exploration - let's try this
- **Level 2**: Adoption - corporate support
- **Level 3**: Efficient - widely adopted

## Organization Maturity Matrix

### Transparency

#### Plans & Products - Level 0

- Individuals and teams do not regularly disclose their plans or products to
  multiple stakeholders.
- No formal actions exists at the organization.

#### Plans & Products - Level 1

- Individuals and teams give visibility to their plans or products to multiple
  stakeholders, before they are started.
- Shared roadmap.

#### Plans & Products - Level 2

- There are already shared roadmaps with clear guidelines and contribution rules
  where stakeholders can provide feedback.
- However this is not standardized across the organization and not all of the
  projects provide this info.

#### Plans & Products - Level 3

- Roadmaps are shared by default and there is a standard process and homogeneous
  way to do this across the organization at the level of each InnerSource
  project.
- This contains clear rules to contribute and influence in the roadmap.
