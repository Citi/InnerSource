Project maintainers can find additional resources in the [FINOS Maintainers Cheatsheet](https://odp.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet/).

- **All participants** in FINOS project meetings are subject to the [LF Antitrust Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/), the [FINOS Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Code-of-Conduct.md) and all other [FINOS policies](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#policies). 

- FINOS meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of FINOS and the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws. Please contact legal@finos.org with any questions.
